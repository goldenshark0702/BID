Dear employer,

Be it a custom template design, product management, addition or removal of products, fixing existing bugs/issues, shipping integration, payment gateway integration, installation, Magento 2.0 coding or anything related to this e-commerce platform, I render each and every eCommerce development service in a better manageable way. Kindly let me know when we can talk.

Few similar projects we have worked on:

- https://www.loveweddingbands.com/ (We upgraded the existing jewelry eCommerce website from Magento 1 to Magento 2 as database and coding of both the versions were totally different. We successfully overcome the challenge and created the Magento 2 website by developing many complex features of online stores)

- https://www.chelseaparis.com/ (The client has a great collection of boutique ladies luxury shoes and therefore he anticipated us to list the products superbly and grab the attention of potential customers. We have used PHP, Magento 2.0, and MySQL to meet the client objectives and provide them fully responsive website and uploaded the images of products provided by the client.)

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,
